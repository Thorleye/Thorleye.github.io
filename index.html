                    I am Eric Thorley, a Toronto-based, goal oriented software engineer. 
                </h3>

                <p>
                    My philosophy revolves around creating efficient and profitable products that not only satisfy clients' wants and needs but also meet customer demands in the market. I am committed to delivering solutions that align with market trends and drive business growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a strong advocate of test-first development and engineering principles, as they ensure high-quality design and establish clear timelines and expectations for projects. This approach minimizes risks and enhances the reliability of the final product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a background in sales, I have developed a deep appreciation for the values of relationship building and collaboration. My experience has honed my skills as a clear and effective communicator, enabling me to articulate complex ideas and foster strong, productive partnerships.
